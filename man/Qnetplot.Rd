\title{Q-Q plot for network meta-analysis (Q-Q netplot).}
\usage{
Qnetplot(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{object of class NMAoutlier_measures (mandatory).}
}
\description{
This function generates the Q-Q plot (Q-Q net plot) for network meta-analyisis model.
}
\details{
Plot of Q-squared Mahalanobis distance for each study in the network.
Vertical axis provides the Q-squared Mahalanobis distance for each i study included in the network.
Horizontal axis provides the Q estimated quantile. Q estimated quantiles are the theoretical quantiles from the normal distribution.
A reference line is fitted from the cartesian points of the two measures. The normal Q-Q netplot tool allows to detect observation(s)
that are away from the reference line. This can be
an indication that normality cannot be assumed in the data and an outlying study exist.

Q-Q plot for network meta-analysis (Q-Q netplot) has been introduced by Petropoulou et al. 2020.
