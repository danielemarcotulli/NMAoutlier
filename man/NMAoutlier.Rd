\description{
This function employs the Forward Search algorithm to detect outliers
and influential studies fitted in network meta-analysis model from graph-theory.
This is an outlying diagnostic tool to detect outliers and studies that are potential
sources for heterogeneity and inconsistency in network meta-analysis.

Monitoring measures during the search are:
\itemize{
\item outlier detection measures (standardized residuals, Cook's distance,
  ratio of variance);
\item ranking measures (P-scores);
\item heterogeneity and inconsistency measures (Q statistics for
  overall heterogeneity / inconsistency, inconsistency by
  design-by-treatment interaction model, z-values for comparison
  between direct and indirect evidence by back-calculation method).
}

A description of the outlier detection methodology can be found in Petropoulou et
al. (2021).

\details{
FS algorithm for network meta-analysis
model from graph theory is described in Petropoulou et al. (2021).

Let \emph{n} be the number of treatments and let
\emph{m} be the number of pairwise treatment comparisons.  If there
are only two-arm studies, \emph{m} is equal to the number of studies. Let
TE and seTE be the vectors of observed effects and their standard
errors.  Comparisons belonging to multi-arm studies are identified
by identical study labels (argument \code{studlab}).

The FS algorithm is an outlier diagnostic iterative procedure. FS algorithm
apart from three steps. It starts with a subset of studies and it
gradually adds studies until all studies entered.  After the
search, statistical measures are monitored for sharp changes.

In more detail, the FS algorithm starts with an initial subset of the dataset with
size \emph{l}.  Let (argument \code{P}) (eg. \emph{P} = 100) a
large number of candidate subset of studies with size \emph{l}.
The candidate subset that optimize the criterion (argument
\code{crit1}) is taken as the initial subset (considered ideally to be
outlying-free).  Criterion (\code{crit1}) to be used for selecting
the initial subset, can be the minimum of median absolute residuals
\code{"R"} or the maximum of median absolute likelihood
contributions \code{"L"}.  It is conventionally refer this subset
as basic set, whereas the remaining studies constitute the
non-basic set.

The FS algorithm gradually adds studies from the non-basic to the
basic subset based on how close the former studies are to the
hypothesized model fit in the basic set.  A study from non-basic
set entered into the basic set if optimize the criterion (argument
\code{crit2}).  Criterion (\code{crit2}) for selecting the study
from non-basic to basic set may be the minimum of median absolute
residuals \code{"R"} or the maximum of median absolute likelihood
contributions \code{"L"}.  The algorithm order the studies
according to their closeness to the basic set by adding the study
that optimize the criterion from non-basic set to basic set.

The process is repeated until all studies are entered into the basic
set.  The number of iterations of algorithm \emph{index} is equal
to the total number of studies minus the number of studies entered
into the initial subset. Through the FS procedure,
parameter estimates (summary estmates, heterogeneity
estimator) and other statistics of interest (outlying measures,
heterogeneity and inconsistency measures, ranking measures) are
monitored. In each iteration, network meta-analysis model from
graph theory [Rucker, 2012] is fitted (\code{netmeta} function)
with R package \bold{netmeta} [Rucker et al., 2018].

Monitoring statistical measures for each FS iteration can be:

\bold{Outlying detection measures:}
Standardized residuals (arithmetic mean in case of multi-arm
studies); Cook's statistic; Ratio of determinants of
variance-covariance matrix

\bold{Ranking measures:}
P-scores for ranking of treatments [Rucker G & Schwarzer G (2015)]
for each basic set with implementation of (\code{netrank} function)
from R package \bold{netmeta}.

\bold{Heterogeneity and inconsistency measures:}
Overall heterogeneity / inconsistency Q statistic (\code{Q}) This
is the design-based decomposition of Cochran Q as provided by Krahn
et al.(2013); Overall heterogeneity Q statistic (\code{Q});
Between-designs Q statistic (\code{Q}), based on a random effects
model with square-root of between-study variance estimated embedded
in a full design-by-treatment interaction model.  Implementation
with (\code{decomp.design} function) from R package \bold{netmeta};
Z-values [Dias et al., 2010; Konig et al., 2013] for comparison
between direct and indirect evidence in
each iteration of forward search algorithm.  By monitoring
difference of direct and indirect evidence, potential sources of
consistency can be detected with the implementation of
(\code{netsplit} function) from R package \bold{netmeta} for each
iteration of the search.
