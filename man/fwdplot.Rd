\title{Forward plot(s) to monitor selected statistic(s)/method(s)}
\usage{
fwdplot(x, stat, select.st = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class NMAoutlier (mandatory).}

\item{stat}{statistical measure to be monitored in forward plot(s)
(mandatory), available choice are: "pscore", "nsplit", "estand",
"heterog", "cook", "ratio", or "Q" (can be abbreviated).}

\item{select.st}{selected statistic (pscore/nsplit/estand) for
selected treatment(s)/comparison(s)/study}
}
\description{
This function generates forward plot(s) to monitor selected
statistic(s) and/or method(s).  The function creates a plot of the
selected statistic throughout the iterations of the forward search
algorithm.  Candidate statistics to be monitored can be P-score;
z-values by back-calculation method to derive indirect estimates
from direct pairwise comparisons and network estimates;
standardized residuals; heterogeneity variance estimator; Cook's
distance; ratio of variances; Q statistics (Overall heterogeneity /
inconsistency Q statistic (\code{Q}), overall heterogeneity Q
statistic (\code{Q}), between-designs Q statistic (\code{Q}), based
on a random effects design-by-treatment interaction model).
}
\details{
Plot of statistical measures for each iteration of search.
Vertical axis provides iterations of search. Horizontal axis
provides a monitoring statistical measure.
