\title{
Network meta-analysis comparing smoking cessation counseling programs.
}
\description{
Example of outlying detection in network meta-analysis comparing the relative effects of four smoking cessation counseling programs, no contact (A), self-help (B), individual counseling (C) and group counseling (D).
The outcome is the number of individuals with successful smoking cessation at 6 to 12 months.
These data are in contrast format with effect size odds ratio (OR) and its standard error.
Arm-level data can be found in Dias et al.(2013).
