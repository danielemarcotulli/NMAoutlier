Description: A package that employs the forward search (FS) algorithm for detecting outlying or influential studies in network meta-analysis (NMA).
               Provides the length of the initial oultying-free clean subset for forward search algorithm.
               Iterations of forward search algorithm.
               Basic set of studies in each step of forward search algorithm.
               Summary estimates and their confidence intervals in each step of forward search algorithm.
               Outlier and influential case diagnostics measures. 
               Ranking measures.
               Heterogeneity and inconsistency measures.
               Forward plot for summary estimates and their confidence intervals.
               Forward plots for monitored measures: outlier and influential case diagnostics measures, ranking measures, heterogeneity and inconsistency measures.
