Description: A set of functions providing the forward search algorithm for detecting outlying studies (studies with extreme findings) in network meta-analysis.
               Provides the length of the initial subset for forward search algorithm.
               Iterations of forward search algorithm.
               Basic set of studies in each step of forward search algorithm.
               Summary estimates and their confidence intervals in each step of forward search algorithm.
               Outlying case diagnostics measures. 
               Ranking measures.
               Heterogeneity and inconsistency measures.
               Forward plot for summary estimates and their confidence intervals.
               Forward plots for monitored measures: outlying case diagnostics measures, ranking measures, heterogeneity and inconsistency measures.
