Description: A set of functions providing several outlier (i.e., studies with extreme findings) and influential delection measures and methodologies in network meta-analysis:
               - Simply outlier and influential detection measures provided: (a) Raw, (b) Standardized, (c) Studentized residuals; (d) Mahalanobis distance and (c) leverage.
               - Outlier and influential detection measures by considering study deletion (Shift the mean): (a) Raw (b) Standardized, (c) Studentized deleted residuals; 
                 (d) Cook distance; (e) COVRATIO; (f) weight “leave one out”; (g) leverage “leave one out”; (h) heterogeneity “leave one out”; 
                 (i) R heterogeneity; (k) R Qtotal; (l) R Qheterogeneity (m);  R Qinconsistency and (n) DFBETAS.
               - Plots for outlier and influential detection simply and deletion measures (all the aboved measures) and Q-Q plot for network meta-analysis.
               - Forward Search algorithm in network meta-analysis. 
               - Forward plots for the monitoring statistics in each step of Forward search algorithm:
                 (a) P-scores; (b) z-values for difference of direct and indirect evidence with back-calculation method; 
                 (c) Standardized residuals; (d) heterogeneity variance estimator; (e) cook distance; (f) ratio of variances; 
                 (g) Q statistics.
               - Forward plots for summary estimates and their confidence intervals in each step of forward search algorithm.   
               - Random Shift Variance metwork meta-analysis (RSV NMA) model for outlier detection.
               - Plots for the monitoring measures of RSV NMA model:
                 (a) P-scores; (b) z-values for difference of direct and indirect evidence with back-calculation method; 
                 (c) Standardized residuals; (d) heterogeneity variance estimator; (e) Q statistics; (f) shift variance estimator; 
                 (g) leverage; (h)likelihood ratio test (LRT).
               - Plots for summary treatment estimates and their confidence intervals with RSV NMA model.
