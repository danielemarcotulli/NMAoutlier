Description: A set of functions providing the forward search algorithm for detecting outlying studies (i.e., studies with extreme findings) in network meta-analysis:
               - provides the length of the initial subset for forward search algorithm;
               - iterations of forward search algorithm;
               - basic set of studies in each step of forward search algorithm;
               - summary estimates and their confidence intervals in each step of forward search algorithm;
               - outlying case diagnostics measures; 
               - ranking measures;
               - heterogeneity and inconsistency measures;
               - forward plot for summary estimates and their confidence intervals;
               - forward plots for monitored measures: outlying case diagnostics measures, ranking measures, heterogeneity, and inconsistency measures.
