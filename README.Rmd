## Description

A package that provides forward search algorithm for detecting outlying or influential studies in network meta-analysis.

- Provides the length of the initial oultying-free clean subset for forward search algorithm.
- Iterations of forward search algorithm.
- Basic set of studies in each iteration of forward search algorithm.
- Summary estimates and their confidence intervals in each iteration of forward search algorithm.
- Outlier and influential case diagnostics measures. 
- Ranking measures.
- Heterogeneity and inconsistency measures.
- Forward plots for summary estimates and their confidence intervals.
- Forward plots for monitored measures: outlier and influential case diagnostics measures, ranking measures, heterogeneity and inconsistency measures.
